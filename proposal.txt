Project Title:
Automatic Musical Key Detection Tool

Objective:
To develop a Python application that analyzes an audio file and accurately identifies its musical key (e.g., C major, A minor), helping musicians, producers, and DJs better understand or organize their music.

Scope & Features:
Load .wav or .mp3 audio files.

Extract pitch content using chroma features (e.g., Constant-Q Transform).

Compare pitch distribution to standard major/minor key profiles.

Output the most likely musical key.

Optional: visualize chroma energy across the 12 semitones.

Technical Details:
Libraries: librosa, numpy, soundfile, matplotlib

Core Algorithm: Match chroma vector (mean or weighted) to predefined key profiles using cosine similarity or correlation.

Optional Enhancements:

Detect modulations (key changes over time)

Add a GUI using tkinter or PyQt

Batch mode to analyze multiple files

Expected Outcome:
A working Python script or simple app that provides musicians and audio engineers with fast, reasonably accurate musical key analysis of audio files.
